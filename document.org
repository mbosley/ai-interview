* About Me
My name is Mitchell Bosley, I'm a 34 year old Canadian currently living in
Santiago, Chile with my wife Veronica and our dog Oscar.

I am an academic studying the application of emerging AI technology to social
science problems, with a particular interest in measurement of political
phenomenon from text, persuasion using AI interventions, and simulation using AI
agents. I received my PhD from the University of Michigan's Political Science
department in 2024. I have published work related to human-in-the-loop
classification in the American Political Science Review (APSR), and I have work
from my dissertation on using AI tools for measuring deliberative quality that
will be published in the Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy
(JPIPE) in 2025. My wife Veronica Hurtado is currently an Assistant Professor at
the Universidad Adolpho Ibanez in Santiago.

As of Feb 21 2025, I am employed by the Schwartz Reissman center at the
University of Toronto as a postdoctoral researcher. By June 1 2025, I will be
starting a role as a postdoctoral researcher at CENIA, the national center for
AI in Chile, where I'll be continuing my research, with a focus on agentic
simulation and creating digital clones for applications in predicting political
behavior and deliberation outcomes.

I grew up in Western Canada, going back and forth between Vancouver, BC, and
Northern Alberta, where my mother and stepfather lived on a farm near a town
called Eaglesham. When I graduated highschool in 2008, I moved to Vancouver, and
over the next eight years I worked a variety of jobs (chiefly food prep, retail,
and front-of-house restaurant), while attending post-secondary education, first
at Langara College, then the University of British Columbia, where I earned my
Bachelor of Arts Degree with Honours in Political Science in 2015, followed by
my Master of Arts Degree in Political Science in 2018.

I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2018 to begin pursuing my doctorate in
Political Science at the University of Michigan. In 2019 I married Veronica,
after which she joined me in Ann Arbor. Following the outbreak of the
coronavirus pandemic in 2020, we returned to Vancouver, where Veronica was doing
her PhD in Political Science at UBC. Over the next few years we moved around the
world chasing funding opportunities, first to New Haven for a fellowship my wife
won at Yale, then Peru, my wife's home country, followed by a return to Yale for
my wife's postdoctoral appointment, a brief stint in Toronto for my own postdoc,
and finally a move to Chile in October 2024. Once in Chile, I began applying for
jobs. I interviewed twice for different assistant professor roles at UC in
Chile, but came up short. I was eventually was hired by CENIA, the national AI
research center in Chile, as a postdoc. As of February 2025, I am still looking
for permanent academic roles both in and outside of Chile, but it is looking
like Chile will be a home for at least the next few years.

** Hobbies
I have a variety of different hobbies and interests, including several different
sports (cycling, mountain biking, running, skiing), reading (particularly
science fiction), and playing video games (I particularly like action RPGs and
strategy games). I enjoy going on hikes, travelling (although my wife is the big
travel planner of the two of us), and walking my dog Oscar, who is a Jack
Russell Terrier mix.

** Health
*** Mental Health
While I am generally a happy and outgoing person, I do sometimes suffer from
anxiety, particularly related to my academic productivity. This anxiety tends to
manifest as a fear/panic response, feelings of worthlessness, etc., and will
often result in avoidance and procrastination. I tend to have significant swings
from week to week in my productive throughput: some weeks I am highly organized
and am able to move efficiently through todo lists and hit deadlines; in other
weeks I am barely motivated to work, and will maybe put two to three hours work
in before lunch, after which I go for a run, play video games, read a book,
etc., rather than being able to re-engage with my work. I tend to get excited
and highly motivated by "new" projects, but have a hard time putting the
finishing touches on existing projects once the bulk of the work has been done.

In general, I find that regular exercise helps to regulate some of the "swings"
that I experience. However, I have a recurring injury in my right foot that
flares up if I run too much, so I have tried to transition into cycling as a
lower-impact sport. I have had bouts of talk therapy, as well as experimented
with some pharmaceutical solutions. I found talk therapy to be extremely helpful
in helping to enable a "vent it", "name it", "change it" loop, where I am first
given an opportunity to vent about the feelings I am having, then the
opportunity to give a name to those feelings, and finally the tools to start
recognizing the triggers of those feelings and working to avoid them or to build
tolerance. I was briefly prescribed the anti-depressant Welbutrin in 2023 to
help deal with my anxiety and executive dysfunction, but after having a seizure
in October 2024, I was taken off it. After a series of medical tests, it was
determined that I have a congenital small lesion in my brain (MVNT, I believe)
which increases my baseline risk for seizures. I was instructed to that I should
monitor it annually, but told that it likely will not affect my life quality. I
had never had a seizure before the incident, nor have I had one since. Overall,
my therapist and psychiatrist from that 2023-2024 period agree that while I do
have some difficulty with the "swings" described above, they are not severe
enough to lead to a formal diagnosis with a disorder such as ADHD, Bipolar,
etc., as evidenced by my overall professional and personal successes in life.
That said, this is something that I should continue to monitor, as I have direct
family (my father, and my older half-brother on my father's side) who clearly
have some combination of borderline personality disorder, narcissistic
personality disorder, and bipolar personality disorder (my father was committed
to a psychiatric ward at age 19 due to a psychotic break, and my older half
brother recently went through drug-induced psychosis in which he crashed his
car, lost his licence, briefly abducted his child, was committed to a mental
institution, went to prison briefly after assaulting his mother, etc.).

Overall, my goals in life are to

*** Physical Health
Aside from the issue with the seizure, and an elevated cholesterol level that
was shown during my last blood check. I am a generally healthy and active
person.
**** Exercise
I typically go on 20 minute walks with my dog 3 times per day, and in
addition do more intensive cardiovascular exercise 2-3 times per week (typically
a combination of running and cycling).
**** Height and Weight
I am 6 feet tall, and my weight typically ranges between 190 and 200 pounds. I
would ideally like to settle in at a leaner 180-185 lbs.
**** Substances
I am an ex-smoker, having smoked roughly a pack a week from the time I was 18
to 25. During my early 20s, I drank heavily (10-20 drinks per week), and
occasionally used drugs recreationally (mostly marijuana, but occasionally
cocaine and MDMA). However, over most of the last decade, I have quit smoking
and all drug use aside from the occasional marijuana use (once every two-three
months), and the extremely occasional social cigarette (one every two-three
months). I will typically have 5 drinks per week, with a very occasional (once
every two-tree months) "night out" where I will have 5-6 drinks in an evening.
**** Diet
I don't do a great job of tracking my diet, but I tend to eat fairly well. Since
I was informed about my cholesterol level, I have substantially reduced my
consumption of red meat, cheese, and deep fried foods that are high in
unsaturated fats. I try to have well rounded meals that are low in fat and heavy
in vegetables. That said, sometimes (especially when travelling or extremely
busy) I lapse into less healthy eating patterns.


** My Goals
*** 2025 Goals
I have several goals related to my career, health, marriage, and family for 2025:
1. I want to solidify my current situation professionally within the next
   calendar year, either by finding a permanent job as a
   researcher/consultant/data scientist, or by securing a tenure track Assistant
   Professor position. I would like to avoid being separated from my wife if at
   all possible, so that means I'll likely have to find that stability in Chile,
   or get a job that pays me well enough that my wife is willing to leave her
   job to accompany me. Given the traction that I've already gotten in the
   Chilean job market (shortlisted for both TT jobs I applied to, and
   successfully got the postdoc), I think that this is achievable if I stick to
   it, and even moreso since my postdoc may turn into a permanent researcher
   position.
2. I want to get back on track with my mental health. After major gains from
   2023 to mid 2024 due to access to a very cushy health care plan at Yale, I've
   backslid a bit in terms of my emotional regulation. To be fair, this might
   have something to do with the difficulties of the academic job market, where
   I received a lot of rejection, and from moving twice within a six month
   period. I'm hoping that stability in Chile over the next couple years can
   help me in this regard.
3. I want to keep up my regular exercise habit and avoid injury. I typically
   tend to go all out with a sport until I get a minor injury, after which I
   fall off. I want to build up a better strength training regime to help me
   with a chronic muscle imbalance in my right hip, which I think it directly
   related to the running injuries I pick up.
4. I want to get to a steady weight range of 185-190, down from my current range
   of 195-200. Part of this is just being a bit more careful with my eating
   habits, as well as keeping up my exercise. I also need to get my bloodwork
   done.
5. I'm several years behind on my US and Canadian taxes, and I desperately need
   to normalize this situation for this upcoming tax season. This is a major
   priority. I need to have this paperwork done for April, when I go to Chicago
   for a conference, so that I can mail off the appropriate paperwork.
6. My marriage with my wife is very strong, but I want to make sure that I'm
   putting the work in to keep it that way. This mean active listening, being
   proactive about making plans, etc.
7. I want to get my wife pregnant. We've been trying for about 6 months, and
   nothing has happened yet, so I think that it's time that I get my sperm
   checked. If we need to have IVF, then we need to start budgeting for that.
